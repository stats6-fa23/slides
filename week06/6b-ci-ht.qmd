Examples from this lecture are mainly taken from the [Bayes Rules! book](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) and the new functions are from the `bayesrules` package.

## Recall

Last lecture the optimist had the following models.

```{r}
summarize_beta_binomial(14, 1, y = 9, n = 20)
```

. . .

Prior model: $\pi \sim \text{Beta}(14, 1)$

We can read this as the variable $\pi$ follows a Beta model with parameters 14 and 1.

. . .

Posterior model: $\pi|Y \sim \text{Beta}(23, 12)$

We can read this as $\pi$ given $Y$ (i.e., the data) follows a Beta model with parameters 23 and 12.

## 

```{r}
plot_beta_binomial(14, 1, y = 9, n = 20)
```

# Credible Intervals

## 

We are often interested in how our ideas change from prior to posterior. 

One measure that can capture this change is the credible interval. 

## Prior credible interval


```{r}
#| echo: false
ci_prior <- qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 14, 1)
```

According to optimist's prior model the probability that $\pi$ is between 
`r ci_prior[1]` and `r ci_prior[2]` is 95%. 


## 


```{r}
#| echo: false
pi <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
y <- dbeta(pi, 14,1)

data <- tibble(pi = pi, y = y)

qplot(pi, y, data = data, 
          geom = "line") +
  geom_ribbon(data = subset(data, pi > ci_prior[1] & pi < ci_prior[2]),
              aes(ymax = y), 
                  ymin = 0,
                  fill = "#e56646", 
                  colour = NA, 
                  alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.9, y = 1.5, label = "95%")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
pi <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
y <- dbeta(pi, 14,1)

data <- tibble(pi = pi, y = y)

qplot(pi, y, data = data, 
          geom = "line") +
  geom_ribbon(data = subset(data, pi > ci_prior[1] & pi < ci_prior[2]),
              aes(ymax = y), 
                  ymin = 0,
                  fill = "#e56646", 
                  colour = NA, 
                  alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.9, y = 1.5, label = "95%") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = ci_prior[1], 
                   y = dbeta(ci_prior[1], 14, 1), 
                   xend = 0.65, 
                   yend =  5),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "cm"))) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.65, y = 5.5, label = "2.5th percentile") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.99, 
                   y = 12.5, 
                   xend = 0.8, 
                   yend =  16),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "cm"))) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.8, y = 17, label = "97.5th percentile")
```
## Prior Credible Interval

```{r}
qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 14, 1)
```

We can utilize the `qbeta()` function to calculate the middle 95% prior credible interval. 

For a given quantile (probability) the `qbeta()` function returns the corresponding $\pi$ value. 

We are essentially calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. 

## Posterior credible interval

```{r}
qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 23, 12)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
posterior_ci <- qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 23, 12)
```

After having observed the data, optimist's posterior model indicates that with 95% probability $\pi$ is between `r posterior_ci[1]` and `r posterior_ci[2]`.

# Hypothesis Testing

## Recall feminist's data analysis

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
summarize_beta_binomial(5, 11, y = 9, n = 20)

plot_beta_binomial(5, 11, y = 9, n = 20) 
```

## Scenario

Let's assume that the general public assumes that more than one-third of the movies pass the Bechdel test. In other words, they believe $\pi \geq 0.33$.

While working on his prior model, the feminist was unsure of this and wanted to put this claim to test during his data analysis. 

## Setting hypotheses

$H_0: \pi \geq 0.33$  
$H_A: \pi < 0.33$

The null hypothesis ($H_0$) represents the status quo and the alternative hypothesis, ($H_a$), is feminist's claim that he'd like to test.

## Prior Probability

What is the prior probability that $\pi$ is less than 0.33 ? In other words $P(\pi < 0.33) = ?$

. . .


```{r}
prior_prob <- pbeta(0.33, 5 , 11)
prior_prob
```

Note that `pbeta(0.33, 5, 11)` always shows probability that $pi$ is less than a specific value, in this case 0.33 for a specific Beta distribution, in this case Beta (5,11). 


## Posterior Probability

What is the posterior probability that $\pi$ is less than 0.33 after having observed the data? In other words $P(\pi |Y < 0.33) = ?$

. . .

```{r}
posterior_prob <- pbeta(0.33, 14 , 22)
posterior_prob
```

##

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
plot_prob_plot <- function(a,b,cutoff){
  ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0,1)), aes(x=x)) + 
    stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(a, b), xlim = c(0,cutoff), geom = "area", fill = "lightblue") + 
    stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(a, b)) + 
    geom_segment(aes(x = cutoff, xend = cutoff, y = 0, yend = dbeta(cutoff, a, b))) +
    labs(x = expression(pi), y = "density")
}

plot_prob_plot(5, 11, cutoff = 0.33) + 
  lims(x = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Prior")
```

##

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
plot_prob_plot(14, 22, cutoff = 0.33) + 
  lims(x = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Posterior")
```


## 

$$P(\pi<0.33)$$

```{r}
#| echo: true
prior_prob <- pbeta(0.33, 5, 11)
prior_prob
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
prior_odds <- prior_prob / (1 - prior_prob)
```

$$\text{Prior odds } = \frac{P(H_a)}{P(H_0)} = `r prior_odds` \; .$$ 

```{r}
#| echo: true
prior_odds <- prior_prob / (1 - prior_prob)
prior_odds
```

## 

$$P(\pi | Y <0.33)$$

```{r}
#| echo: true
posterior_prob <- pbeta(0.33, 14, 22)
posterior_prob
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
posterior_odds <- posterior_prob / (1 - posterior_prob)
```

$$\text{Posterior odds } = \frac{P(H_a |Y)}{P(H_0 |Y)} = `r posterior_odds` \; .$$ 

```{r}
#| echo: true
posterior_odds <- posterior_prob / (1 - posterior_prob)
posterior_odds
```

## The __Bayes Factor (BF)__ compares the posterior odds to the prior odds, hence provides insight into just how much the feminist's understanding about movies passing the Bechdel test _evolved_ upon observing the sample data:


$$\text{Bayes Factor} = \frac{\text{Posterior odds }}{\text{Prior odds }}$$

```{r echo = FALSE}
BF <- posterior_odds / prior_odds
```


## Bayes Factor

In a hypothesis test of two competing hypotheses, $H_a$ vs $H_0$, the Bayes Factor is an odds ratio for $H_a$:

$$\text{Bayes Factor}
= \frac{\text{Posterior odds}}{\text{Prior odds}}
= \frac{P(H_a | Y) / P(H_0 | Y)}{P(H_a) / P(H_0)}
 \; .$$


##

As a ratio, it's meaningful to compare the Bayes Factor (BF)\ to 1.  To this end, consider three possible scenarios:

1. BF = 1:  The plausibility of $H_a$ _didn't change_ in light of the observed data.
2. BF > 1:  The plausibility of $H_a$ _increased_ in light of the observed data.  Thus the greater the Bayes Factor, the more convincing the evidence for $H_a$.
3. BF < 1:  The plausibility of $H_a$ _decreased_ in light of the observed data.
