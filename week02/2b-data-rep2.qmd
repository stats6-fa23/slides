# Data Visualization 

##

In the last lecture we have made basic data visualizations. 
In this lecture we will improve them to make them more accessible.

# Data Represented with Text

## Assistive Technology

Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. 

Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers


## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer.

The video shows use of a screen reader briefly.

## Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 

## Manual Alternate Text

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)


[Cesal, 2020](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Description conveys meaning in the data

- Variables included on the axes

- Scale described within the description

- Type of plot is described

## Data Verbalization -  Automated

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 4
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(transmission = if_else(am == 0, "automatic", "manual"))
```


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4
#| echo: false
example_barplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = transmission)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20))
example_barplot
```

The automated alternate text for this plot is on the next slide.


## Data Verbalization -  Automated


```{r}
#| echo: true
BrailleR::VI(example_barplot)
```

<hr>

Drawback of using `VI()` is that not every type of plot can be verbalized yet. 


## Guidelines

## Caption vs. Alt-Text

# Data Represented with Sound

## Data Represented as a Tactile Representation
